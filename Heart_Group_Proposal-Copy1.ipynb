    "We aim to build a classification model that predicts the condition of patients, classifying them in one of the five stages of heart disease (0-4). 0 means that the patients have no heart disease, and the others represent the severity of heart disease in increasing order. We also want to know if our model is accurate in making predictions.\n"

    "- We chose four variables as our predictors: age, resting blood pressure (trestbps), serum cholesterol (chol), and ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (oldpeak). We removed character and categorical variables because they are difficult to use as predictors in K-NN classification. The “thalach” column is excluded because maximum heart rate happens once. The chosen variables are better indicators because they represent the overall condition of a person.\n",
    "- We will train our model to use K-NN classification to classify the stage of heart disease from 0 to 4 using our predictors.\n",
    "- The visualization of scatterplot matrix will help us visualize the training data, with different colors representing disease stages, showing the relation between predictors and the stage of disease.\n",
    "- Cross-validation will help us determine the best K-value. With the K-value, we can create the K-NN model by setting the mode to “classification” and the engine to “kknn”, and then scale the data using “recipe”. Then, we can use workflow to fit the model to the scaled data.\n",
    "- The prediction accuracy will be calculated using the training model to classify the data from the testing data and then by dividing the number of correct predictions by the total number of predictions. \n",
    "We will optimize the accuracy by testing different training and testing data splits, and then by choosing the model with the highest accuracy.\n"
